### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Graduated in Information Systems, I consolidated my career as a Full Stack Developer, working for 9 years with java. The Java knowledge provided me great opportunities and I could experience different kinds of projects, financial, agriculture, and public health where I contributed to the health minister of Brazil.

Since 2017 I decided to face new challenges, moving to a new stack, I continued working with software development, but in this new moment with javascript. 

With more than 10 years of working in software development, in my last job experiences, I participated in many different projects with different stacks, blockchain, and other technologies.

I embrace the opportunity to continually learn new things. To me, a tech stack serves as a versatile tool for crafting solutions and overcoming challenges. This perspective allows me to remain open-minded and flexible, never confined to a single stack. Instead, I enthusiastically seek growth and improvement beyond the confines of any specific stack, aiming to become a more skilled and accomplished professional.
